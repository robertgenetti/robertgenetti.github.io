# My Portfolio
I have assembled in this portfolio a collection of work done that is representative of the skill level and technical experience as a data analysis. Project one is a dive into the Our World In Data covid dataset, and explores how vaccinations globally have had on tempering the effects of the virus. Project two takes a look at Seattle WA real estate, more specifically, what the conditions of the market for distress properties and how investors might - with real time data - have a clear view of the market to convert underperforming assets into higher value. The third project is more a series of dashboards that together are a tool for gaining insights into the S&P 500 market and what value might potentially present a good investment.
