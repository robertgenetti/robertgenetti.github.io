Covid-19 dashboard that presents up to date key measures on health and vaccine status to inform policy makers and assist in directing further policy decisions. 

### Problem

In the early days of the Covid-19 Pandemic world policy makers and health organizations had little to compare to what they were going through. Now, most of the policy decisions that were made in the two plus years that followed have come to an end. And with it the chance to look back at the data collected and present an organized look at what impact was had on the nations that enacted them. 

### Solution 

This project takes publicly available data from Our World In Data and presents a set of key measures that when taken together give a holistic view of the impact of policies on public health presented in an easy to read dashboard.

Future plans include expanding the map features so that when a user clicks on a property link it sends then to a detail page with more information. Another improvement would be to integrate the program into an app or website to be used as a service or online reference.
