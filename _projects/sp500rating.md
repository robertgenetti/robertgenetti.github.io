### Plan (4 Steps)
1. Extract, Transform, and Load
    - Pull list of companies in S&P 500
    - Pull financial data from Yahoo Finance
    - Sort and transform data in Pandas
    - Import dataframes into SQL Postgres Database
2. Analyze buy/sell recommendation data in Python
    - Select features best suited
    - Transform data to limit outliers
    - Import into SQL Postgres Database 
3. Build Linear Regression with Fixed Effects in R
    - Explore data
    - Perform linear regression on test data
    - Use fixed effects to seperate sector bias
4. Design Tableau dashboard
    - Screener to filter companies based on specific measures
    - Buy/sell recommendation estimate -- OLS model
    - Income statement KPIs
    - Balance sheet KPIs
    - Cashflow statement KPIs

### Extract, Transform, and Load
- Data source: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
- Four different datasets were collected: general info, income statement, balance sheet, cashflow statement
- Info dataset common features: symbol, date, total revenue, debt/equity 
- Income Statement dataset common features: ticker, date, net income, cost of revenue 
- Balance Sheet dataset common features: ticker, date, total assets, total liabilities  
- Cashflow Statement dataset common features: ticker, date, cash from operations, cash from financing

#### Jupyter Notebook
- Build ETL functions to extract and load data into Postgresql database

### Conclusion

            <p>When I began investing for the first time I had trouble identifying trends and value in the equities market. The novice investors are at risk of making investment decisions based on incomplete information. That is why having a dedicated stock screener and buy/sell recommendations model is important to improving financial analysis skills.</p>
            <p>Jan 2023, when this projectâ€™s data was last updated, the financial market was in a decidedly downward correction, shifting from the elevated levels of the year and a half before to a slightly lower valuations. Following this trend was lower projected earnings and less favorable buy/sell recommendations. Our own OLS model estimated a majority of stocks as a hold recommendation indicating a pull back in investments is underway.</p>
            <p>This project began as simple idea, to build a data visualization that would improve financial statement analysis and recommend buy/sell targets provided with the most recent data. For me the project gave me a better understanding of how different segments of the market are valued and what financial ratios to look for when analyzing specific stocks.
